West was born in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania, in 1738, when the American colonies were still part of the British Empire, and became an renowned history painter and the second president of England’s Royal Academy of Arts. While in London, West befriended Franklin, a fellow Pennsylvanian, but did not render this likeness of the celebrated scientist and American statesman until after his death, creating it as a study for a larger, unrealized portrait that he planned to give to Pennsylvania Hospital, an institution Franklin founded in Philadelphia. West intended to display the larger picture with another of his compositions and a self-portrait, perhaps as an homage to Americans who had achieved international acclaim in science and the arts."},null,{"PMA URL":"http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/37846.html","ObjectID":"37846","Object Number":"1883-89","Image Filename":"1883-89-ov.jpg","Artist 1":"Lodovico Mazzanti, Italian (born Orvieto, active Rome and Naples), c. 1679 - 1775","Artist 2":"","Artist 3":"","Artist 4":"","Artist 5":"","Artist 6":"","Artist 7":"","Title 1":"The Death of Saint Francis Xavier","Title 2":"","Title 3":"","Title 4":"","Date":"c. 1740-1745","Date Search Begin":"1735","Date Search End":"1745","Classification":"Paintings","Dynasty":"","Period":"","Reign":"","Style":"Late Baroque","Movement":"","School":"","Medium":"Oil on canvas","Materials":"oil paint","Techniques":"","Support":"canvas","Dimensions":"17 7/16 x 14 inches (44.3 x 35.6 cm)","Dimension Type":"Overall","Dimension 1":"17.44","Dimension 2":"14.02","Dimension 3":"","Gallery Location":"Gallery 283, European Art 1500-1850, second floor","Geography":"","Latitude":"","Longitude":"","Credit Line":"The Bloomfield Moore Collection, 1883","Gallery Label":"An important Jesuit missionary, Francis Xavier became ill on a desolate island in the Bay of Canton, China, and died there on December 3, 1552.

Representing the mid-century romantic taste for blockbuster marines, Moran followed the lead of J.M.W. Turner, whose work he would have known from engravings. Strong contrasts of light and dark, a swirling merger of sea and sky, and a convincing grasp of natural detail contribute to a sensational effect of chaos and danger in this early work. Moran enjoyed a long and distinguished career as a painter of historical marines."},{"PMA URL":"http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/38993.html","ObjectID":"38993","Object Number":"1903-878","Image Filename":"1903-878-pma.jpg","Artist 1":"Juan Rodríguez Juárez, Mexican, c. 1675 - 1728","Artist 2":"","Artist 3":"","Artist 4":"","Artist 5":"","Artist 6":"","Artist 7":"","Title 1":"Virgin and Child","Title 2":"","Title 3":"","Title 4":"","Date":"c. 1700","Date Search Begin":"1695","Date Search End":"1705","Classification":"Paintings","Dynasty":"","Period":"","Reign":"","Style":"Spanish Colonial","Movement":"","School":"","Medium":"Oil on copper","Materials":"","Techniques":"","Support":"copper","Dimensions":"11 x 8 1/2 inches (27.9 x 21.6 cm)","Dimension Type":"Overall","Dimension 1":"10.98","Dimension 2":"8.5","Dimension 3":"","Gallery Location":"Gallery 272, European Art 1500-1850, second floor","Geography":"Mexico","Latitude":"23.0000","Longitude":"-102.0000","Credit Line":"The Dr. Robert H.
