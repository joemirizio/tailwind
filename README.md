# Tailwind
**PMA Hackathon 2018**

Tailwinds evolved out of a desire to create a digital docent: someone to guide visitors to works in the museum's collection and help them experience the art in a holistic, inclusive way. We wanted to create an app that was simple in design and a powerhouse behind the scenes: one that would allow visitors to the PMA to have a rich, engaging experience directly with the objects on display by way of an easy-to-use, personalized guide.
